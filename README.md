I made this using code that was generated from ChatGPT when I entered the prompt "p5.js code for a face of girl hours". ChatGPT included this text with the output: 

"Interpretation: 
Girl” → Soft, youthful, feminine features
“Hours” → Time, clocks, cycles, phases (e.g. moon, day/night)" 

According to Wikipedia, girl-hour is "(historical, obsolete) A unit of computing power in the context of 1940s–1970s technology equal to one female worker working for one hour, for example, writing code or entering data to punch cards." https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/girl-hour
